<h2 data-id="page#12">4, Special Category Data (also known as <q>sensitive personal data</q>) collected and processed</h2>
<div data-id="page#13">
<p>We currently have no such data other than on any individuals Nationality which in some cases will already be in the public domain.</p>
</div>
<h2 data-id="page#14">5, Our policy regarding collecting and processing children's data</h2>
<div data-id="page#15">
<p>We have Privacy Policies in place with Children in mind such as enhanced Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA's) We cannot stop children providing data to us but where relevant we make sure that the child understands what they are consenting to, and we do not exploit any imbalance in power in the relationship between us.</p>
<p>The following are some guidance pointers, as directed by the Information Commissioners Office, that we have adopted in our dealings with children;<br> 5.1, Children have the same rights as adults over their personal data. These include the rights to access their personal data; request rectification; object to processing and have their personal data erased. 5.2, Children merit specific protection when you use their personal data for marketing purposes or creating personality or user profiles.<br> 5.3, We must have a lawful basis for processing a child's personal data. Consent is one possible lawful basis for processing, but it is not the only option. Sometimes using an alternative basis is more appropriate and provides better protection for the child.<br> 5.4, If we are relying on consent as our lawful basis for processing personal data, when offering an online service directly to a child, only children aged 13 or over are able provide their own consent. (This is the age proposed in the Data Protection Bill and is subject to Parliamentary approval).<br> 5.5, For children under this age we need to get consent from whoever holds parental responsibility for the child - unless the online service we offer is a preventive or counselling service.<br> As a matter of good practice, we use DPIA's to help us assess and mitigate the risks to children.<br> If our processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedom of children then we always do a DPIA.</p>
</div>
<h2 data-id="page#16">6, The Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
<div data-id="page#17">
