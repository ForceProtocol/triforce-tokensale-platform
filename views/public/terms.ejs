					<p>Last updated: 21/09/2017</p>

					<h2>introduction</h2>
					
						<p>These terms and conditions (the "T&amp;Cs") govern the basis on which you, 
						("you" or the "Contributor"), can make a contribution (a "Contribution") to TriForce Tokens ltd ("we" or "TFT") in exchange for the "FORCE" cryptocurrency created by TFT.</p>
						
						<p>These T&amp;Cs also set out the procedure for the subsequent allocation to you of transferable
						cryptographic blockchain-based digital assets, each called a TriForce Tokens ("FORCE").</p>

						<p>You need to read these T&amp;Cs carefully, and should keep a copy for future reference. </p>
						<p>We have defined terms in these T&amp;Cs as they are used. However please note the following definitions:<br><br>
						
							<b>Fiat Money:</b> This means fiat money that is money made legal tender by a government decree.<br><br>
							<b>FORCE:</b> This is a transferable cryptographic blockchain-based digital asset. FORCE does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent right in or
							relating to FORCE, the TFT Platform, and/or any software, any public or private company, corporation, entity or property; and<br><br>
							<b>TFT Platform:</b> This platform is planned to be developed from the proceeds of the contributions to us.<br><br>
							<b>TFT Wallet:</b> is the initial repository for FORCE.<br><br>
							<b>Software:</b> this refers to the underlying software application and software platform TFT is based on, including the TFT Platform the TFT-Wallet and
							the Ethereum Network, as well as any other relevant software, technology and technical concepts.</p>
							
							<br />
							
					<h2>risks</h2>
						<p>2.1) You should only make a Contribution in return for FORCE if you are happy with the risks of doing so. We are undertaking a relatively new type of fundraising. There
						may, therefore, be unforeseen risks of which we are currently unaware.</p>
						<p>2.2) The usual risks involved in making this type of Contribution, and with the allocation, use and ownership of FORCE are set out below. You should read these
						carefully and only make a Contribution if you are comfortable with accepting these risks:</p>
						
						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">2.2.1) Risk of software weaknesses: The Software is still in an early development stage and unproven. This means that:</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.1.1) we cannot warranty that the process for receipt, use and ownership of FORCE will be uninterrupted or error-free; and</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.1.2) there is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories we use could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs ("Glitches"). Glitches
								could cause, inter alia, complete loss of FORCE and/or Ethereum Network.</p>
						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">2.2.2) Regulatory risk: crypto-currency and the underlying blockchain
								technology is currently subject to relatively light regulatory oversight.
								This is, however, subject to change. In the future, certain regulators or
								other governmental authorities may impose or extend regulations which
								could apply to either of these technologies. These regulations may have
								a negative impact on the current set-up of TFT or the underlying
								Ethereum Network on which TFT is based. These regulations could
								result in substantial modifications of the Software. There is also a risk
								that regulatory developments could cause their termination and the
								consequential loss of your FORCE.
						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">2.2.3) Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The allocation of FORCE and the development of the TFT Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including:</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.3.1) lack of interest from industry;</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.3.2) lack of interest from the public;</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.3.3) lack of funding; or</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.3.4) lack of commercial success or prospects (for example, as a result of competing projects).</p>

						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">This means that, even if the TFT Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, you may not receive any functionality through the FORCE you hold.</p>

						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">2.2.4) Risk of theft: The Software may be attacked by hackers or other
							individuals. If successful, such attacks could result in the theft or loss
							of FORCE, or the theft or loss of your Contributions, as well as impact our
							ability to develop and launch the TFT Platform.</p>
						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">2.2.5) Risk of blockchain mining attacks: As with other public blockchainbased systems that depend on independent miners,
							the Ethereum Network may be susceptible to mining attacks. These attacks may occur in a wide range of forms, and include but are not limited to:</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.5.1) double-spend attacks,</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.5.2) majority mining power attacks,</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.5.3) "selfish-mining" attacks, and</p>
							<p class="col-lg-offset-2 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-offset-2 ">2.2.5.4) race condition attacks. </p>
						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">Any successful attacks are a risk to the Ethereum Network, the expected proper execution and sequencing of FORCE transactions, and the expected
							proper execution and sequencing of software computations.</p>
						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">2.2.6) Liquidity risk: FORCE is a new form of token currency and so market
							liquidity is not guaranteed and the value of FORCE over time (if any) may
							experience extreme volatility or depreciate in full. Lack of liquidity may
							cause difficulty in obtaining value should you decide to sell FORCE, or
							indeed may make it difficult for you to sell your FORCE at all;</p>
						<p class="col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">2.2.7) General economic risks: Please be aware that the value of FORCE can
							fall as well as rise. You may not get back the full amount of your
							Contribution should you sell your FORCE. The value of FORCE may depend on
							fluctuations in the financial markets, or other economic factors, which
							are outside our control. The past performance of other cryptographic
							tokens is not necessarily a guide to the future performance of FORCE.</p>
						<p>2.3) As long as we have acted in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for any of
							the risks set out above, to the maximum extent allowed by law, as we view you
							accepting these as part of your decision whether to make a Contribution.</p>
							
							<br />
							
					<h2>3) audit of the TFT token code</h2>
						<p>3.1) Technical experts have, on a reasonable efforts basis, audited and approved the
							Software and TFT code with regard to their functionality, accuracy and security
							standards. Those experts have confirmed the FORCE Token Code (the "Code")
							has been programmed according to the most currently available security practices
							and standards.</p>
						<p>3.2) However, the software and technology that we have used is still in an early
							development stage. Its application is of an experimental nature which carries
							significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks.</p>
						<p>3.3) Therefore, while the audit raises the level of security and accuracy, you
							understand and accept that it does not amount to any form of warranty, either
							direct or indirect, that the Code does not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities
							or bugs which could cause, for example, the complete loss of FORCE and/or
							Ethereum Network.</p>
							
							<br />
							
					<h2>4) conditions for making a contribution</h2>
						<p>4.1 You may not make a Contribution if you are a US citizen, or a person or entity
							permanently resident in the US or any of its territories. In the event you do make
							a Contribution where you are any of the above, you accept any and all risks, costs
							and damages associated with making a Contribution.</p>

						these entities.</p>
					<p>5.8) It is your sole responsibility to provide all necessary information to us to allow us
						to both open a FORCE Wallet for you to enable us to deliver FORCE to you.</p>
					<p>5.9) Upon you making a successful Contribution, we will record information regarding
						the quantity of FORCE that we will allocate to you in proportion to your Contribution
						(including any eligible discount award). This amount will be confirmed to you by
						email. If your Contribution is in a currency other than GBP, we will calculate the
						amount of the Contribution on the basis of the relevant exchange rate, as set out
						in section 5.9.</p>
					<p>5.10) We will use best endeavours to comply with the timetable for the allocation of FORCE
						tokens upon confirmation of receiving your contribution, however this is subject to Section 0, Risks of making
						a Contribution.</p>

					<br />
					
					<h2>10) taxation and other costs</h2>
					<p>10.1) We do not provide, nor do we accept responsibility for, legal, tax or accounting
						advice. Tax treatment depends on your individual circumstances and may be
						subject to change in the future. Please note that taxes and costs may exist that
						are not paid via us or imposed by us.</p>
					<p>10.2) You have sole responsibility for determining if your Contribution, the allocation,
						use or ownership of FORCE, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value
						of FORCE over time (if any), the sale and purchase of FORCE and/or any other action
						or transaction related to the TFT Platform and Ethereum Network have tax
						implications for you. By taking any of these actions, you agree not to hold any
						third party (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any
						tax liability associated with or arising from them.</p>

					<br />
					
					<h2>11) exclusion from liability</h2>
					<p>11.1) None of TFT, any developers, auditors, contractors or founders and/or the
						TFT Platform operators accept any liability in relation to use of, or inability to
						use TFT or the FORCE Wallet or Software to the maximum extent permitted by
						law, including as a result of any negligence or breach of contract, so long as such
						individuals have acted in good faith.</p>
					<p>11.2) In addition, you acknowledge that TFT and the developers, auditors, contractors
						or founders of TFT or the TFT Platform are not liable, and you agree not to
						seek to hold them liable, for the conduct of third parties, including other creators
						of TFT, or for any regulatory implications or liability associated with or arising
						from your allocation, ownership or use of FORCE or any other action or transaction
						in relation to the TFT Platform and/or the Ethereum Network. As such, you
						acknowledge that the risk of creating, holding and using FORCE rests entirely with
						you.</p>
					<p>11.3) Please note, however, that the above does not limit or exclude liability for fraud
						or death or personal injury.</p>

					<br />
					
					<h2>12) personal information</h2>
					<p>12.1) For the purposes of these T&amp;Cs, TFT is the data controller (as that term is
						defined in the Data Protection Act 1998 ("DPA")) of the personal information that
						you provide to us or which we otherwise process under these T&amp;Cs. This is
						because TFT (either acting alone or jointly with others) determines why and
						how your personal information is processed and otherwise used in connection with
						your Contribution and FORCE token allocation. By personal information, we mean
						information which, either by itself or when combined with other information that
						we hold or which is available to us, can be used to identify you. Our contact details
						are below if you have any queries about this.</p>
					<p>12.2) TFT will use your personal information to liaise with you in relation to your
						Contributions and FORCE token allocation under these T&amp;Cs. TFT will process the
						following personal information in connection with your Contribution and FORCE token
						allocation and FORCE Wallet: your full name, your contact details (such as your
						email address). TFT will process your personal information to administer your
						Contribution, open a FORCE Wallet for you and for the purpose of the FORCE token
						allocation. Depending on how you make your
						Contribution (whether online via https://triforcetokens.io or through a third
						party) TFT may collect this personal information directly or indirectly. TFT
						may disclose your personal information with third parties including subcontractors
						acting on our behalf such as back-up and server hosting providers,
						our IT software and maintenance providers and member(s) of TFT's group of
						companies who are relevant to what we do under these T&amp;Cs. Where TFT or
						any such third parties process your personal information outside the European
						Economic Area, steps will be taken to ensure that adequate levels of protection
						as are needed under the DPA apply are maintained.</p>
					<p>12.3) TFT may disclose your personal information to any Government or regulatory
						body, or to law enforcement agencies (such as the police) where required for
						compliance with laws and/or regulatory requirements, or for the prevention or
						detection of crime. In addition, TFT may share your personal information with
						our legal and professional advisors and with third parties in relation to any
						business restructuring such as purchasers of our business or assets (as relevant).
						It may be shared with tax authorities ("HMRC") and with courts where permitted
						or required under applicable laws.</p>
					<p>12.4) Under the DPA you have the right to request from TFT a copy of any of your
						personal data that we hold by making a Subject Access Request (SAR). You can
						make a SAR by writing to us by post or by email (see below). A nominal statutory
						fee of GBP10 may apply.</p>
					<p>12.5) TFT may use your contact information for marketing its respective similar
						products or services or those of TFT's group of companies. Contact may be by
						SMS text, post, telephone or e-mail subject to appropriate prior consents, where
						necessary. If at any point you decide that you do not want us to use your
						information in this way, please let us know by contacting us using the details
						below. TFT may share your contact information with companies in its group
						where it has your consent to do this.</p>
						
						
					<br />
					
					<h2>13) miscellaneous</h2>
					<p>13.1) The law of England and Wales applies to these T&amp;Cs and any agreement you enter
						with us under them. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with the TFT
						fundraise, the creation of the TFT and the development and execution of the
						FORCE Wallet and the TFT Platform shall be exclusively and finally settled by
						the ordinary courts of England and Wales.</p>
					<p>13.2) If any portion of these T&amp;Cs is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part,
						such provision shall be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of

						in any other manner and without affecting the remaining provisions of these T&amp;Cs,
						which shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p>
					<p>13.3) The TFT is registered and operates in the United Kingdom. Consequently, all
						contributions, the contribution procedure, the TFT creation and TFT allocation are
						considered to be executed in the UK.</p>
					<p>13.4) These T&amp;Cs govern the Contributions, and the allocation, use and holding of TFT,
						and supersede any other public statements about the launch of TFT Platform
						and/or TFT made by anyone.</p>
					<p>13.5) No other document or communication may modify or add any additional
						obligations or covenants on us beyond those set forth in these T&amp;Cs document,
						unless we explicitly state otherwise in that document.</p>
					<p>13.6) This document is for information purposes only. It does not constitute a
						prospectus of any sort, is not tended as a solicitation for investment and does not
						pertain in any way to making a regulated offer of securities in any jurisdiction.</p>
					<p>13.7) TFT is not an authorised firm listed by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and
						neither the contribution nor the FORCE is offered as an FCA regulated product or
						service.</p>
